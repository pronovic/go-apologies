# Apologies Go Library

This is a Go library that implements a game similar to the [Sorry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorry!_(game)) board game.

_This is a work-in-progress._

I'm in the process of implementing this as a learning exercise. My goal is to re-implement something that is functionally similar to the original Python version ([apologies](https://github.com/pronovic/apologies)), except in GoLang.  This problem is interesting enough that it should help me get my head around the language.
